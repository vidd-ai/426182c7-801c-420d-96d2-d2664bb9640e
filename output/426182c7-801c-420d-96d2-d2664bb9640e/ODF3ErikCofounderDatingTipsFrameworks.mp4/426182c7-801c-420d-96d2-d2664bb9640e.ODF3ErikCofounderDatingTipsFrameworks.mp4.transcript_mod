 If you're done if you can chat done. Otherwise, I'll give it maybe three more minutes.
 Most people finish up just want to draw attention to this pickle that tuned in.
  I actually have to jump another call guys. So if anyone wants to pick a later hit me up.
  You need to add lashes.
  Lord finesse plushies
  That's what you needed me co-founder guys.
  If you guys are done if you could just chat done. Otherwise, I'll
  I got at least three people. Okay, once you get the 10 people done, we will.
  Rite Aid, I believe 9.
  Okay.
  So here's the next thing we're going to do. I'm going to sort of take maybe like 10 questions as you know in no specific order. If you feel compelled to physically ask a question or say yours what you want to talk about in a session and then we'll sort of go through.
  Each individual 1 throughout the session of so there be a lot of overlap. So basically the prompt is either your specific question or something you want us to talk about in this in this group together and this is interactive thread. So I encourage you to not leave you guys a question but also appreciate your guys's responses and if he back and answers the first we're going to take questions, so in no order you a question that we want to talk about just jump in and out and in and say it and if you took it to go to the same time, you know one person will go in and do a person can go out there.
  And I will be writing them down so I can somebody asked the first question. You mentioned something about like to know the product and vice-versa. What if you have both the vision and you can build the products like what what kind of complementary skills do you look for? What if you could do it all next questions?
  And what was your name right about that? I am curious about the successful matches that you made during previous co-host like, you know, what surprised you would went. Well with didn't go well.
  regression table
  when you're doing Saturday Ting, how do you want to think about like the top of the funnel and like you want to make sure you spend enough time with individuals, right? So you don't want to go to the top of this on all but then like that can like affect how how long is potentially takes because you you know, you want a single thread things potentially so you don't have like a bunch of people in the same face or or or how do you think about that? And I just not just for General somebody producing next. What's the right length for like a trial. So you want to make sure your honeymoon phase but not make it like ears.
  great question
  I have a question. Basically. I'm just interested in you know, I've always kind of sounded with teams. I've worked at previously and there's always has to be a high success rate with that if you have evidence of success in finding someone Anthony and Company, they have a bunch of people.
  Can you repeat your question real quick? That's why I've done my lost two companies blood test. But I guess I'm a little bit kind of looking for evidence that you know, you can still create a successful startup from finding someone, you know, the Apple watch it before and still clay senior.
  Great question. Jump on as soon as people are finished.
  Yeah, hi. This is a sheet that I have a question about again. Also bad battery dating. So huge plus one to whoever wins. Were me on working with people you already knew which and there's a certain Comfort level there. You know, you work with the person before you know, the quality there. Were you been true significant disagreements at work before but they're still I think the challenge is there still hard conversations that you need to have about who makes decisions. How do we think about who wants to be the CEO vs. Like we're only going to play how do you scale etcetera curious to hear? What point how soon do you start this conversation's as you go to the founder dating process?
  Great Western Michigan around rolls is a equity split at founding right. So, how do you go about that? You just do a hundred / end if you're going to deviate from that. How do you hook up a conversation?
  And why?
  I'd like to add something to that as well. I'm in the Serafin like working on my project for a while. Now. It's been almost a year but still want to bring on someone in that co-founder Roll But approaching the equity conversation and get some more complicated as when you know progress has been made. Are you a lot of work has already gone in and also like helping. Potential person feel like it's their project to even though the lot has happened before they got there may be some of those Dynamics are helping a little hard to navigate.
  Yeah. Yeah, I took on two fronts one is at what point do you stop worrying about finding that co-founder? Even if you want to if you didn't work on your projects for X number of months and 2 is there a good process for Life transition contractor to part-time people to work full-time on potentially co-founder capitals.
  I have a question as well. How much do you rely on first impression? I would say I have a coffee with someone and I'm like either. Yes. I was feeling gas refueling know at what point do you decide if something is a no and like like even in the first meeting?
  Hey Eric, Stein here question about like the date itself. But if you sound really successful activities to are like day tips. You mentioned a couple of them in your tweetstorm. Pretty awesome. Go on a road trip me to spouse but I lost in those sound like good bad and ugly stories about like a great day tips.
  Asana
  first one to the question where you ask about how do you make someone your bring on feel like they're part of the project if you've been working on it for a while religious about how do you how do you know when is the best time to bring somebody on generally if you started working on something and you're talking to customers and you're doing research what when when is too late Wednesday or early?
  Question here how important the location when working with the co-founder. Does it have to be in the same place or if I find someone was on the opposite Coast is it worth working with?
  Quick question. How do you view people with life situations? That mean they can't commit full-time at first thinking about someone with that unique financial situation where you can't raise funding they want to continue working at the real job and on the side or if they're in school to finishing up a PG programmer Masters where the work would be thrown away. Like they would get the degree if they don't stay for another nine months. Do you want to start now? How do you think about hard time and temp or a law steps for when founders want to work together on something?
  Great question on that note, like if if you're in a situation where like one or the other or multiple Founders would ever want to invest in a company. Like how do you like split that among different people? Like if one person's like yeah, I'm going to put in you know, a bunch of Angel funding is like get this going but the other founder is like how do you start a trade that in balance of like little investment in the company?
  Is it a question if someone invest money into the company? How should I could he be treated? My question is how to think about trade-offs when you and your co-founder have a great Dynamic and work really well together, but you have very similar backgrounds skill sets and roll and Trust.
  68 one more time
  You and your co-founder don't have complementary skill sets but much more overlapping skill sets interesting backgrounds.
  Erikson's known as I want to know. How how do you is there a way to protect yourself against split ends to draft the agreement where when you're both excited about the project is to think about if some for some reason that we have to split how do we mitigate the damage caused by that split Beyond and if so, how do you talk about that?
  Another few minutes or a couple minutes. Is it better to start a project or a company with the potential cook number?
  How do you what's the difference between where we thought about where we're going to set up? We formalize the company and took it like really really professionally and very seriously, but then the splits in terms of mid-levels versus like you start with here's a project. We're going to see how we work together and if something comes off if we make a company around it and we think through like a grievance and everything else so curious to get here to take ya.
  I'm curious how you would assess when you have like one co-founder who is potentially more passionately if you think it would work really well with someone but you have one one co-founder attention more passionate about an idea or S. Come up with the idea. And therefore it feels really entrenched on it where you make the trade-offs of being like, this is somebody I could work really well with but it's maybe not something that I'm as body known as an idea until I flush that out more so meaning when
  How do you think about working on an idea? You're not that excited about but could be big exactly it's like do do you say this is somebody that I can work really well with and I should take that risk and some format through dating or taking a project or do you say because working with somebody and findings to get both on her so difficult to do as well that maybe you take the risk on the project at the idea of the difference between a valuable is a co-founder versus passion and interest. Yeah, I wouldn't trade off on idea or co-founder now sometimes the idea that you were sort of a test idea to see if that's the one that you you know, if you guys are well do situated to work together. But if your vehicle. Or signing up for a 5 to 10 your journey and if you're not excited about the yeah, yeah, we're not excited enough about building a business a big business separate from any idea then it's probably, you know, not a recipe for success and co-founder.
  Find butts sort store good ideas. And so you don't want to trade off on an idler.
  So this is a
  a co-founder by the time a customer starts signing on this is still a good idea to keep looking for a co-founder or is it better to just go ahead and hire for. You can actually burn equity.
  Repeat that one more time if you have customers like when is it too late to bring on a co-founder of the customer signing up should you just be looking for a first employee? I think the answer is in a couple argue last variations of this question the market sort of what will determine like if you are you sign on your first customer and your sort of you to the business person and you're both product and you find this amazing engineer who would only join if they're cooking under well, then, you know you the calculus you make is will my piece of the pie. Even if it's reduced by half still be worth more because bringing this person on U-verse has some other engineer I can bring on as a first employee. It's really just heard of any Goshi ation. Not just with some people but also with the realities of the recording Market how good can you find somebody but co-founder is like there's no sort of like it's sort of like if I'm 50 years old. Should I still find a girlfriend?
  No matter how late you are in the process. It really depends on how much leverage you have how much you've either you still need to how much US versus how much you still need to be risk and your comfort level on getting up enough enough equity basically just it's not calculus. So what's what's the best person I can find for 50% vs. What's the best person I can find for 1% or 30% or could even 10% I saw one negotiated recently joined after a fundraising round what happened and it should be brought her on actually, this is on that company that you brought Iran for her about 10% and he could have found somebody for for 1% you know already having already raised like four or five million dollars, but this person was ten times better and shoot and there's no like right number for what it sent us and where is 20% is really a negotiation and
  Any other questions and I'm answering some of them real time just so they don't get lost.
  Okay, awesome. So if we were all in the same place, I would go one by one and then people would interrupted and we would pay you back from there. But I think that's a bit harder in this group. So I think what I'll do is I'll take maybe 10 minutes 5 to 10 minutes and try to go one by one of the other ones that I saw and what I want you guys to do is want you all to do is to write down whenever you have a follow-up question and you can either put it in the chat or you could you say that before I put it in the chat or you can you hold on to it for for later, but I'm in a lot of questions like a question might try to weave through and I also encourage people to put in their own point of view and feel free to also put it in the chat and if I find it particularly powerful and I say hey
  Am I calling you and say expand expand more on that the best way to do that. But if you also feel compelled to feel free to feel free to call me up and there's a link to your questions all the questions. You guys ask Brandon put a put in it and I do it today after the session maybe like
  I don't have seven times and this is probably the best best I ever questions and I don't just say that every every time we merged into the other Google doc if you can see that supposed to think there's already one in progress submerged M. Awesome also. Okay. So Madeline a sander a few variations of this question is know if I can have I have the idea and I can build it do I even need a co-founder and I love that question because I needed the first thing in my tweetstorm is in what look for a compounder is someone who directs the business and so what you're looking to do. Is there any easier if it's a specific idea, but even if it's just you and I found her what are the uses you start a company just look up your job company. What are the biggest reasons that the company is likely to fail and can a co-founder are there certain others?
  I want to bring that would significantly dear esque the company such that you should give you a 50% and just a quick note on splits. I think you should if you're starting from scratch. I think you should usually always give 50% I don't really buy the 51 before you 9% What I like is actually clean Division. I want economics to be as close to equal as possible and I want but I want the fishing making to be as far away as possible and what I mean by that is sort of formal and legal decision-making. There should be a clear CEO of clear tiebreaker a clear decision maker a clear person who can fire the other
  That person is usually the person who has the vision and we can get into you know, when to have that conversation and how to have it in a bit. But the the reason is that the economics front it is a few people asked what's the way to make it feel like there's well, you don't give them to give them a piece of the outside and it's sort of a clean division of hey, you're you're with 50-50 Partners on this but in terms of tiebreaker decision you to do always has to be one person or else it's going to be chaos. Someone's always going to be resentful and you know, you're not going to make decisions effectively. Now even within that decision-making framework, that's not to say that you also want to clear that. It's very collaborative decision-making process and you can also say that within certain like your regions of the companies are signs that you took a tissue areas of the company you you're the furthest person you're looking to the farthest person, but ultimately if you have
  Screamin you know your you went out but it's important at the same time that you also usually give them the benefit of the doubt and only use your veto when you when you serve need it at least in their area Bee Company. Let's say you're the nautical found go find her and there is a meeting engineering for the company. Why don't I buy the 50.1 49.9 split because I don't think there's any reason to do it. I think what people think what they're doing is sort of making it legible that they have the final decision making power, but I'd there other ways to legally you justify that or a manifest that and I think of 50.1 49.9 just sort of feels like like a thorn in the side like just a gentle reminder every day. Like I know where 49.9 like I think it's funny cuz it's it's it's just point one bit of equity but it's so much more in terms of motivation in terms of I am a widow. How do people tip
  You know what people think about being equal often, it's not just how they feel internally but it's how they feel it will represent two others. That's why I titled or so important because they they manifest others. I also think you should be super generous of you should get out co-founder titles, even if the person gets 10% even if even if they get 5% sometimes LinkedIn at 7 co-founders, I think you should give up your founding engineer first employed essay titles because it signals to external audiences of sense of ownership and that you eat your meaningfully involved. That's why I don't think the 50.1 it is necessary for what it's trying to trying to cheat. You don't have to have a computer if if you thinks if you can bring a product to Market get customers is your dearest most of the business Jetta founding team order or get co-founders who you don't have to give 50% Equity to I think
  Yeah, it's just a personal decision between you and what you think the company can do and then your ability to your ability to recruit but the reasons to get the best reason you got to go batteries because it will make your Equity worth more. I even get world-class people who can do you rescue the the company the another reason is to have sort of a co-partner in in in the very stressful Journey that is found in company, but you people have that among their founding team as well. How do investors use Stella Founders when fundraising there used to be a stigma against it and maybe they're there still is a little bit but we back solo Founders and I think if it's really just kind of person do you risk the the company and then some companies you have certain domain expertise that they need to have some companies require.
  Technical expertise some companies require, you know relationships with customers and so it is rare that one person has all of those things. But sometimes they do we back the company called bear or SIM. For example, that is is a free clinical trial company that's trying to take animals out of animal testing and replacing them replaced them with machine learning models and she is a PhD computer science Ph.D. Veterinarian and her she is it from a family of like Pharma company Pharma CEO socios, so she has relationships and Technical expertise across different domains. If you can do that all the power to you in terms of bringing one on a bit later or fundraising and you will have more leverage and how you choose that is up to you in an example. I mentioned earlier where is person brought another co-founder for 10%
  Started getting raised $5 if they started a month before they would have been 50-50 and originally he was he was he didn't want to give 10% you want to give 1% and I said, hey as a company been that the rest. Yeah, you raise money. But what would you have to talk to your customers? What if what if you really done and so I think it's yeah, he said extra but he was also able to get someone who is really amazing. And the truth is she wouldn't have left without the guarantee of money so that necklace back to it at least not on special for someone else's question of
  Unequal investments in opportunity. I think I should get and they should get extra Equity as results of that has any investor would at certain terms and we can talk specifics about if someone is not willing to leave their job that is has a negative sign because people have any Financial issues, but they shouldn't get equal Equity to you unless you think they're worth it and I guess what I'm trying to say here is zoom out as it is less about should and shouldn't don't like these moral things about is really just like what the market can determine if someone is so amazing that they in there so much to you and you're unlikely to get other people, you know for for cheaper, then you should give that person 50% even after raising contingent on the unicorn but it's not standard that they do.
  And they are likely replaceable with with other people.
  So they're couple people questions that were asked like if we have overlapping interests and skills or overlapping skills and then
  You know.
  Yeah, I don't have that was basically it if the person doesn't do things for you the business for you then unless you think that you're that much powerful more powerful than Asian vehicle powder and sometimes they can be two double overlap example, you know Ryan Hoover co-products on I was found I came here but later after he lost the product before raise money and she we DoubleDown skill-set sweet we've said hey, we're going to have a great community in a lot of people because this is that hard that we need two of them and the CTO was a business in so that person didn't have found founder equity.
  In terms of breaking breaking off coupon a relation that don't work. It's key that tool yet. Just Alistair Lyon one person can fire the other and if it doesn't work out, you know, if that person you retain, you know, remain remain Supreme and you guys think of the bigger challenges when a co-founder isn't working out with scaling with the company, but you still want to keep them around sometimes I've seen sort of equity negotiations in the second or third year that takes a lot of maturity. But yeah, you saw that basically just see you early.
  The right time to bring on somebody is when you think they can you know, meaningfully. Do you risk it and it sort of like hiring an exact you sort of want to do it like, you know, 326 the nine months before like it as soon as possible start YouTube building relationships with people, but if you have a line of sight to customers and product by yourself, and you know what you want to build by all means, you know Star Building in and getting customers and and then go to a sister power loss you can bring people on as needed, but you'll have more leverage in the process.
  the
  what example of co-founder matching from people who never work together is just lunch today actually in it went around. Caswell Maxim step of panko from previously of coinbase. And then Ryan Delk previously CEO of I need a just like The Homeschool company Maxim came to me and said I have four big ideas that I'm interested in. I'm interested in biotech longevity future of cities education and one more I can remember and Ryan Delk Beto is longtime friend and he said I'm interested in doing something homeschool. I was home-schooled. We connected them. They never met they started a new dating process where they did this user's brainstorms talk about what it's like to you know, what they care about in running a company together spend time together extended trips. I went through overdue sort of the dating ideas in terms of the right amount of time to spend before jumping in I think it's more the quality of time in the immersive Mists of time. So I mean
  You know different people different age brackets can't do this. But if you have an opportunity to look live with that person I would do it. I was just trying to spend as much time as you possibly can in as much sort of your areas of stress as you possibly can say things like hackathons things like road trips things like living together, you know one in a week of living together is worth more than a year of Coffee shots. And so really just try to truncate that pie by committing to add to it as as as much as you can insult someone also asked about how many can you do in parallel? Well, if you spend 3 days with somebody like, you know all day long have it all the conversations you have a pretty good idea. So when you have a first impression of Simon Elsa Elsa Elsa mentioned that like if we're talkin 1 hour at that that's that's that's not enough unless it's like they don't have the skills or you know, it's just obvious. But if anything he might just be a personality mismatch like really dig in there and so it turns out, do parallel you can like
  You can do a bunch of Carla. It's really just in terms of how you structure it. It's it again. It's you can spend all Thursday with somebody off, right it was somebody else all weekend with with with somebody like just I think went when you do want to date the first start of the initial like hey, should we even explored us and it's in 1 hour 2 hours, but it actually even Explore this you get the things out all on the table in terms of what's what's most important to you about running a company. Maybe you do the questionnaire or something that the first round set in and then if you say OK remove the stuff too, and I restore it now, let's commit to a certain Cadence of like, hey, let's meet every Thursday or every every X and Y, you know the entire day together, or maybe it's it if you guys are both you have left your job. You just want to take that is as quick as you as you possibly can and but do turn it off when it when it's not working cuz you're you're not doing anyone a favor.
  In terms of when to have that conversation of Who Wants to be CEO. I think it's when you so you don't have it. Literally the first you want to have it when you have a good feeling that you want to explore further basically and it depends what you mean by position. If you're in the position of I'm going to be CEO heaven or hell you should probably have the idea by then. You certainly have more leverage that is that person wants to wants to work with you. I think it's a good thing to just float if I would I would have it early and it usually that conversation goes someone knows or both people now and then that serve a conversation or it's hey neither of us really knows but we're open to figuring it out over our journey together and here is how we would figure it out and we're both somewhat differential.
  And the person would be so easy on my opinion is the one who has a vision for the for the company.
  I'm sad and play one verse founder is really just again Market realities. You know, what can you get for one for sandburs? What can you get for 50% and will your Equity be worth more? You know my restriction in terms of contract. I wouldn't really overthink it too much. There is a lot of different ways. It's a person need to get paid.
  Yeah, I think I think it's important that situation to ask like what we need to be true for that person to jump on full-time early on it's a lot of what we need to be true questions will need to be true for you to want to work on this idea or need to be true for you to remove. What's your financial Runway? I have talked about this.
  I'm going to just go back to the
  Darkness radar detector
  Yes, how do you want to think about the top of funnel? You want to have a big top of funnel and bite your waist do that put your put your you know, go on podcasts are going to write blogs about like what you're like could put the bat signal about here is here's what I'm doing and start building a minimum viable audience your Ryan recruited for your me included all the first 10 people from product hunt by their users and they were blocked. So to send that to a skill set for you encourage you to to do that the and yet in the beginning you not only do you want to be you want to be asking everybody hate who do you know that's looking for who you know that be great co-founder would you know that's looking for 4/4 co-founder. If you were leaving your company who's Hugo found something with everything you have asked them for like one or two names and I need those people and then ask those people even if like
  Tana dating the person that I'm dating I also like hey if this doesn't work out like who would you start a company with maybe that someone who we might end up wanting to hire but I feel that sounds pretty wide and then make sure you separate. I think the other different Tier 1 to tier to tier one is we're just having a coffee meeting or we're just having a quick conversation and you might even have like an ocean dock of like hey, here's what's important to me in a co-founder. Here's what I've got like prepare them in advance so they can sell select out like yours and you might want to say like, this is d i d i want to work out or I'm committed to being see you if that's really important to you. So I will weed out of myself selecting and writing sort of like your own sort of Wiki then and then there for the second year and that's your black people. You're actively go better dating like 8, and I think maybe you can only have like five or something at a time.
  If you have the vision, but don't want to be CEO get it to be single most incidents Euro more about what you were looking for in a co-founder then.
  Sure, I guess to some extent so I see myself as a technical person. So I'm looking for someone who has I want to say go to market experience may be experienced when a sales team stuff like that. I wouldn't assume that they still need a vision of the company. Obviously. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't want to work with them. But in terms of you seem to I want to say put it in both we start terms as in like, you know, if you have the vision you should be CEO you should be able to fire the other person. I don't know how he wants us to that has everything it just like dating there are take nothing. I say other than the 50/50. But yeah, it's just like you don't read books. Million different configurations of things. I can work out. Certainly if you are the product beer like I don't want to be CEO or I don't like I don't want to build the company.
  I can see your vision for the company and usually that that involves having a good time for the product to that said if if you don't want to build the company where that's not your skill-set, I think that somebody who shares the vision with you. It's it's I think it's like he's about to know if that person is sort of just sort of listening to you and then sort of like running the company and you're not like, you know, Mark Zuckerberg. It starts to yell like a product a shower when certain elements of the company, but he's like see you again today. So I really question why you don't want to be CEO and it's like hey, I just hate company building then I would get somebody who share the vision of the products with you or else is going to be in my penis.
  okay, so follow on I guess if I am the normal splits I've seen is that the CEO tends to be the more business-oriented maybe salesperson or marketing person is how would it look if you turned it upside down and the CEO where the technical person I would even bring in someone who can deal with the sales side or the marketing side would bees be
  should you think of these as BP's then know this and this is like, you know, Paul Graham sort of like y c in 2005 inverted the structure of what is the side opposite of the Street Apartment a little bit like CEOs are usually like are not Grand like people who are in charge of the product and so the Lend-Lease much easier for them to learn sales and marketing than it is for a sales and marketing person to learn, you know, like how to cook how to build a little bit actually with no code and stuff. But the question is like how do you find a non technical co-founder? Well put yourself out there cuz they'll find you hit sort of like, you know, how can I like you you are the you are the prize and then people want to want to find you so put your ass out like make sure that you are in a lot of different rooms and make sure
  New York meeting right people on and they will recruit you heart and it really just as a quick question to ask is how do you assess whether there any good and I think you want to have some I just wanted visor who is a business or sales expert and you know, how many within on Deck who would be happy to assess the quality the person for you that point which is I think you want to spend especially early on a lot of time and references. Like it'll save you even a bunch of first meetings just like let it let you know Mutual connections. You have a recruiting tweetstorm in within that country song about a reference but references if someone references poorly either don't need or don't have taken meetings are but I would do it early but it's a way to save time.
  Are there some good questions you are but I want to get to if you're dating Five People You like two of them you pick one or do you try to make it at 3% cocoa founding team and get them to meet each other. That is a excellent question. Are there different variations to to do this when it first you should make sure that you know in your heart of hearts that you're believe that your Equity will be worth more if you give up in a few divided into thirds and basically you're working on some complicated like open-door for example required sort of a real estate experience someone to raise a lot of money someone who knew data science and then someone who could go through this beautiful problem. So you have typically if you working really hard product problems require multidisciplinary, it can go either way. So will there two versions of question 1 it at you often do people need to like each other? Yes, they don't need to be like best friends are going to be friends. But if you go counters have different owner doesn't want to work with another co-founder. I personally would say that's
  That's a deal-breaker unless this person is truly the once-in-a-lifetime Unicorn because a person can learn how to like like someone and if you're having a lot of co-founder issues just like any romantic relationship. It's it's time to look in the mirror because you can eat a lot of you no work on working yourself that's best for a separate session on Knock-Knock unication in communication skills to I'd be happy to do it together. Unless one is significantly more important than the other then I will get that person on board first if they're both about equal importance. I would do it in and parallel and I did that actually with with Village Global. I was I had one and then we brought into more and we had them both in the process of the same time to use Reid Hoffman has this post or somewhere about like different sounding moments of
  At any time someone new joins who's really core mission-critical accompany you to mention that they're different County moments the company so maybe it is the question her ass earlier is how do you make how do you make them feel like it's their own thing. And so, can you tell Beth you tell them hate? This is the ground floor show that V Equity but I felt like, you know, we give you give a title if you're finding steamer co-founder and say hey there multiple moments of the company is ultimately I file says we've discussed that every company have told me but I really want to make a culture where everyone's voice is heard everyone feels like they have at a critical input into the the future of the company and you show that buy buy your conversations in and being super cut fire with him about that what's going on?
  how to go back to the list of questions
  Yeah, it was when you zoom it when you move from Tier 1 to tier 2, I I think the I mean just go back to your house that you do and how you do it. Actually, if you act like the questions aren't bring Coke on his right leg. What are the biggest risks to why could fail to fail because you don't relationships with customers and fail because you don't build a compelling enough product fail because you know a number of XYZ reasons and you zoom in when you have so is that sort of determines your criteria for what you're looking to go powder not to mention Also Serve personality like compliments and things like that you zoom in when you have a good would you want to keep going when you have a good idea of Hay Des can just have to go somewhere. And then in that time you should have wanted like as fast as possible if people keep her down sort of explore whether it's a two-day thing when they saying.
  Optimizing for that experience sort of on the margins. It's just important that you do it and that you prioritize it.
  You recruit a co-founder after 6 months of the founding are there certain time to outline the real co-founders? I think we should get out of bed. You ever had a real co-founders not real co-founders, you know for real life example, we have two people who are there from the beginning and then two people were there a year after but for our for our employees we can employees we don't even talk about that really like everyone we brought them all in cocoa powder their equal. We have one more year vesting then they do but you know, we sort of revised the department store because it's it's not particularly important to emphasize that that I was there that I was there first.
  weather notes Here
  Location I think you're not dressed in her that has the world expert on location. We had recently but ideally you want to do it in this location. But I think I can work separate has worked. I think what's important though. I think it during like the brainstorming phase. It's important to be in the same place you can and so when you were like Conjuring up stuff when you were making plans you got you no returns to scale from from being in person when you are executing on those plans. Sometimes actually better to have some some separation, but I think it's important that a regular can medication
  But but but also in terms of seeing if seeing each other to accept that it's feasible.
  Great question Alice, how do you choose a co-founder to your gear S2 business? If you're still evaluating multiple IDs some things you can be rest with you without an idea. So for example, you know, I'm not technical so, you know rest of the company is I know any company I start that involves software is that I can't build the right product. So I know that I need somebody to do that another risk is that at I am not know God's gift to operational execution for complex operational even execution of things like Brandon is so getting somebody like that would be would be courted me to so if I started a company I'll probably have like three or four Founders like Justin Condit, right? Justin gone is a hype Man start Atrium, which had a good run up but didn't succeed and he brought in a great person. He brought in a great legal person and he brought in a great marketing person. So even initially you can sort of
  Some of the things that you want to let you need to two deer ask but yeah, if you're picking between a sore bio thing and a your homeschool thing you you won't know if you need a sort of doctor or PhD in something unless you pursue the about things more seriously, so I'm picking idea interesting ideas, but in parallel as you are, you know Verde and co-founders, you're also idea. And that's actually saying you're you're you're more doing unless you're sure that you don't want to have an idea that you really want to join someone but yeah, then you are cocoa powder dating with the full force of a you know of someone trying to have a kid in the years, I think.
  I'm answering any questions in the chat.
  Yeah, so one thing I would have before it before the meeting. So I think it's a good idea to make it with you by yourself in terms of like to hear the things that important for me in a co-founder hear things are important to me in and run a company for yourself. I think it's also important to have a version that you can share with people you can share it with them before or after beating. But I also think it's important to run a process in a processed meat like you would ask the same people the same questions for the same questions, or at least some of the same question such that you can calibrate accordingly.
  Okay, so someone asked if investors bring up not having cocoa powder. What is it that they're really saying how you frame a response to? Call Mary concerns the hey when you eat them when you say co-founder that is it that you think that there's a skill set that's missing for their business to be successful cuz that's that's what they sow.
  Yeah, cuz I asked him directly and you calm down by either assuring that you have that skill set that still said it or that you have the ability to hire for that Bill said in your people you were thinking about.
  Or that you're committed committed to learning at its best. Obviously if you if you had it, but that's what that's what you're asking for.
  Startup Studios is worthwhile. Take your deed of them and work them to iterate on it build a business is one and I think that we were Atomic is more 1 than there are there's obviously that you get there or that you get access to Capital and sort of inbuilt services if you
  It sort of like if you ever get the con is that you take a huge Equity head and you're probably not in charge of your business. So it's sort of a calculus you'd like. If you are looking to be CEO of your company and decide the vision of your company and build a product of your particular excited about a known most of that company you should not do video if you want to go to mention studio is real quick is a sort of it's an incubator for a company that or vegetable that builds companies internally. So that would they'll do is I'll take people who are in on deck and they will say here here's an idea. Maybe you come up with her. Maybe they come up with it and they will give you somewhere between you know, 10 to 60% to to run that business and they will own the other, you know, 40 to 90%
  Speed dating session is interesting. I think was more interested. Like the way I be using on Deck is like you first do next after yourself. Here's what years would I care about here's what's important to me like make a checkmark next to every person's name and on Deck Zack and potentially like fit, you know, go to LinkedIn like see you like any Mutual connections, you know with people like reference them to make sure that it's not like big red flag, although they're not that I doubt it and then sort of your reach out to them and say like share with them your notion or because everyone on decks already look primed for wanting to start a company and say hey is this something you'd like to explore have a conversation that you're in the same terms and then like agreeing to some version of the oven experiments and and see where they are a lot of its timing like usually one person is like super gun ho
  Maybe two are but sometimes they're they're not yet. So you should keep them on the back burner check in every cent bit like commit to some version of a process that in that process has a Cadence to it and it has like an end date feel like we are going to chat you're out of a job right now. Let's chat once a week for a month a month or two months. And then let's Circle back and see if we want to keep doing this Earl I camp Tampa.
  accelerators, so
  Like incubators and accelerators can be great if that's what you what you are looking for Village Global a weaving accelerator. The accelerator has about 12 to 15 companies for court. So it's much more Hands-On y c is a famous accelerator if I was take 7% of your company in exchange for your extra Services. I think that again it sort of like
  A market like things like what your wifey are helpful for fundraising and for it if you're selling to startups and things like Village are helpful. If you sort of like want access to domain expertise in a specific area and think our Network can can really help there and said we have reason of a lot of Life Healthcare companies are fintech companies or company's where we have like really deep Network. I can help just get access to access to customers.
  Accelerators take 7% of the company and our last hands on incubators take like again 60% and Azan.
  Is a great question. Do you need a domain expert as a co-founder? So I had tweeted something today to the effect. Basically a lot of the hypothesis that has one is Paul Graham said in 2008 or 2005 whenever he said it. There's Arbitrage technical young Founders or people who could be found hers, but don't yet have the skills to start a startup but you know ghost getting those skills are to be taught and dust while she was born and they had an Arbitrage for that type of Thunder 2018 to sort of like this celebration or you know reverence of technical found and sort of this some what state of matter is nothing matters, but now thanks to know code.
  It's like more easy to reach customers without Building Products in advance. And so it's easier to give us things.
  Stop that. Maybe that's why the shifting that's one shot. The other shift is that a lot of the low-hanging fruit in terms of start-up ideas have like a lot of the consumer things have your software is eating a lot of the world's already and it's now extending its tentacles into non-software domain like insurance and we all types of things. I like all types of healthcare all types of Education all types of regulated Industries all types of Niche Industries. The haven't been touched by technology at all, but do require special relationships special expertise in special knowledge. So depends on what your do you need to be an expert at Rising Sun come out of it depends what you want to build if you want to build something that sells to farm on a company's it's pretty hard to do that without somebody who's either worked in that field or you don't have access to those those relationships if if relationships or expertise is, you know,
  Turn the bottle next to building a big business then then you need to do me an expert or someone who has those Russians.
  Great question. Should you better Trey. Co-founder trade-off someone who you like and trust or someone who you don't really know but a good skill set. But at least you know has compromised skill sets, I think.
  What I said, I would take their skill-set question but a certain person but I debate the premise of it a little bit when it in terms of like you got your employee that you can trust to like. He thinks you want people who directed the business now, if you don't trust the people that add the risks the business because what you two ways in which company fail, you know, how to break up or not. If you're see Jonas early, you know, otherwise. Culture or think of things like that, but you can get to know people pretty quickly in my experience if you just prioritize it if you have all the tough conversation and say things like, you know, if if a company fails and 3/6 months, why might that be all right, I reference you and I heard I heard that you like kind of gave up your last company. What do you think?
  Like I have hard conversations early if something is bothering you early on it's unlikely to go away and so it's probably going to get worse unless you work through it early on. So if you say, you know, hey, I heard you gave up your last companies like yeah. Well, I was actually going through you know, this health issue was I don't know if you had some excuse for some reason with your baby if he doesn't take ownership into his like, yeah, I was your fault that co-founder. I hated a person likely to do the same thing for you. So you want to test it as soon as possible ways to accelerate Trust
  It's such a good question references are huge having hard conversations super early like here all the ways that I think this company could fail if I started it. It's it's putting like nothing like cobras are going to share everything and so, you know way more questions then you should or than you think you should and ask it under the auspice of hey, you know, I know this might seem seem weird or something but you know, he's just decided who should we just want to make sure that that is right and it isn't exactly like if you're the CEO, you know, it isn't you can always buy the person so you want to be risk it as much as you can buy you don't want there's anything to find out in 3 to 6 months that you would find out early on just by asking question and I think what people don't realize it if you work in the same company
  Are you friends with somebody for a decade? That's not the same thing as working together. That's not the same and so like do live together do takes us to do like working to do work on projects and ways that you can simulate as much as possible. What would it be like and they have the questionnaire in the first-round questionnaire is pretty good too. But it's like you. Do you want to sell your company for Xmas like, you know, if I put ten scenarios out we have to fire somebody, you do that we have to do this, you do that like we have to spit what would you think about that we have to do that like or investor is trying to fire me like 3 years now, you think about that and you sure just want to like resonate with the way they think about problems?
  Yeah, that is that isn't what I mean by references. I would reach out to Mutual contacts and ask what it's like where to get it. Now, you won't be sensitive to like, you know, if you are still at companies or people that situation sometimes like to ask the person like depending on whether I didn't send it like hey, do you mind if I reach out reach out to a couple people encourage you to do the same thing are some people might want to talk to but the the reference is unless it's like a really bad reference. It's not usually like a like everybody's got some bad reference reference. It's really just how they respond to it. And you want people to sort of like take ownership over it and don't like just blame. The other person is another great question to ask is everything great exact switch on any car battery using take Azura's days at the right back obviously is what would you do if you were CEO of your last company like what are you different?
  And people who don't have good answers don't take significant like ownership over The Company Store over the products. Are you on people who were like, oh, I would have done XYZ thing while also balancing like I do not like totally should have known that person in their likes to go back to the struggles that they had at that time. That's where the best combination of book.
  And everybody listen Everybody Know Jack and I like just paying him and slack like hey, what are you looking for in a cookout at the very least and you did at the very least like maybe I'll know someone who can potentially be via fit. And so if there is, you know, cuz you know 200 people on dacor with you and also look at the past I to ya will it will not let down and and just sort of like the run that process in this is assuming that you're like eager and ready to go ready to go now.
  What's the best structure to talk about personal values and culture? If you have a notion doc about yours that that's pretty cool. You can ask them to write right there's or to get invisible you can ask them to.
  Just talk about it. Like what's what's it going to be like? Oh, I don't regret like what didn't go well in terms of values and culture in your last company like what what are non-negotiables for you or what are what are ways in which it really important that we did this or you be really sad if if we did this
  I need one negative signed by driver. Is it like sometimes you'll go be a couponer is not the CEO who wants to be in like every single thing possible and I think the instinct is positive, but typically they're not be are you have a moaning sound like function and I think it's like
  important to sort of not put them in their place, but I'll say like hay and usually that that comes from problem. To find who's he owes. But like hey, you know, I want you to assume you're doing it because you want to be learning as much as possible representing companies, but it's possible. I want you to feel that you have but I can take notes from that or I can make sure that you get to meet this investor to at some point and don't say. Oh, okay. That's great. Now get back to Building Product etcetera and not have to do it, I'm at every meal.
  Cedar Cove in a relationship you are in a line of things like everyone being full-time raising money. We feel that you're in too deep and His Son cost. What are your thoughts on that that you never too deep man? I think he's probably got a line or at work to see if that's something that you're willing to accept and this is why it's important to see or not to see you and you're not aligned. I eat like you can't move forward without her consistent tension around a certain issue. You can either like agree to disagree and commit or move on but don't repress it Rouses just going to go in and other ways and if you're not the CEO, then you need to Mac. I mean like a decision maker then you need to either accept it or what move on and sometimes you'll be like, hey, I can accept it for like one more year or something.
  Great question. How important is a time commitment on alignment to covid-19 break up due to time from his Gussie's. Yeah, it's less like Dixie hours worth of 65 hours or more like it's less like just not only buying puts us like some people are incredible output machines.
  but it's really
  Jeep is this sufficient priority for the for the company is the person carrying their weight basically and so if they are working 40 hours, but there are like, you know producing more than other people do 60 hours then and there were 50 for you to die Lose Yourself by ha that's amazing if you're like, hey, I'm not getting what I thought I'd be getting for 50% of his company Representatives company then have a conversation about butts. So I think that's when things break up is when someone is at the way more valuable than the other person and you can either we negotiate or where they should leave but it's usually that coordinates with ours but but not often are sometimes someone as a family as I'm a dozen.
  What do you recommend people look for in a coach? I would probably wait till your funded unless you can afford. Otherwise, what do you look for in a coach? It's good question. You know, there are these fancy coaches a reboot or fantastic and Sewer expensive co-coaches if I worked with this NBC coach named Newt who's in Fentress Co Bailey's fantastic, I've been working a lot of communication stuff and I used to work with him every Monday night. And group sessions with him in so you really want to coach for like what are you looking for work on us there something loud like productivity coaches or you different variations, but I think you should have a specific goal of the coach with Coach value and it's just more of a sort of like
  Listener experience or more of like the biggest I see a therapist in the biggest Ally I got him therapist actually was I I put a one pager before every every meeting and that work in and of itself was super valuable. And so if you're you know a scrappy founder, I might do it with another copy found a friend have you know every week or every two weeks like she hears everything that's on my mind and you even that exercise self will be so valuable. But then also it'll be a talking through it and hearing somebody else's experience is also very valuable. So I don't care if you're found her I relationship awesome investors service advisory service for some others coach if you don't have that or if you're looking to on top of that developed or just level of expertise and are willing to pay for
  About 5 more minutes. So any questions you guys have put in the put in the chat?
  Is there is a great white shark?
  One thing I want to see the seperate like people often have reserved a rigorous sort of boundaries of like co-founder not co-founder and expectations that that relate with it. And I think it's getting out of the head of like you deserve a Disney fairytale of what a co-founder experience to be and it's really just like, you know, the reality of what's what what's what's available. What's what's realistic and what your what trade-offs you're willing to take an NCO. Same things are standard and non-standard it is helpful to know as just as a baseline, maybe the default but like, you know, just like, you know anyone to work with who's like a tax person who ever
